# Thesis
The simulation scenario, communication manager, resource manager, middleware interface, network monitoring manager and resource allocation scheme are implemented in the manet-routing-compare.cc file.
The discovery service is implemented in the discoveryApplication.cc file inside the link lifetime folder.
The Markov chain based mobility and link lifetime prediction mechanism is implemented in the markovchain-mobility-model.cc inside the link lifetime folder.
The routing manager is implemented in the myrtable.cc file inside the link lifetime folder.

main.cpp is the file to do the testing of resource allocation algorithm, while dce-iperf.cc consists the complete dce-ns3 code and the implementation of static resource allocation code in DCE-NS-3.
